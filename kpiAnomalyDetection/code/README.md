# About code:
Since we use jupyter notebook to do our job, and we also did lots of experiments, so our codes are disorganized and hard to read. But these codes also contain lots of our experiment results, so in this code directory, we have 3 code files:
* experiment 1.ipynb
* experiment 2.ipynb 
* Final Version ipynb.

The expiment 1.ipynb and experiment 2.ipynb both have lots of our experiment steps, but in experiment 1, it mainly contains about the feature extraction and preprocessing part. It also has model training part, but in the final version of our project, we didn’t use these trained models.

The expriment 2.ipynb file mainly contains model training part of our experiment steps.

To make our codes reflect the final procedure we made to do the labeling job, we organize our codes in experiment 1 and experiment 2 and made the Final Version.ipynb file . But since we didn’t run this file, so in this file we didn’t show any results we got.
